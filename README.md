## Introduction 

Medicaid provides health coverage to millions of Americans, including eligible low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults and people with disabilities. Medicaid is administered by states, according to federal requirements. The program is funded jointly by states and the federal government.
HOW CAN WE PLAN FOR THE HEALTH CHALLENGES OF THE FUTURE? 
HOW CAN POLICYMAKERS HELP PREDICT MEDICAID REQUIREMENTS ACCURATELY?

## Goal
- We want to predict the number of people that would be eligible for Medicaid in 2021

- We want to see how machine learning can help us predict Medicaid and which are techniques are most effective or suitable, given the data we have. 

- We will explore the advantages and disadvantages of each of the techniques


## Data
- American Communitty Census from tidycensus data from 2017, 2018 and 2019
- Constituency data from `https://americanideologyproject.com/Â´


## Technique

- Used a Lasso Regression 

## Scope for Future work 
With more time and a larger team, we can deliver a robust product to the government that can help undertake further research and can apply several more techniques to improve the prediction.
